name: HOC-Krylov Solver
description: HOC-Krylov Solver is a Poisson's equation solver employing conjugate gradient (CG), conjugate gradient squared  (CGS), bi-conjugate gradient stabilized (BiCGSTAB), and their ILU0-preconditioned versions (incomplete Cholesky factorization). The high order compact finite difference stencils (4 and 6th) are applied for the discretization of Poisson's equation which results in the nona-diagonal systems. Selecting the various storage schemes for sparse matrices accompanying the HOC stencil are the key features of this open-source software package. This package enables us to solve Poisson's equation discretized using a HOC scheme with lower exact error and acceptable CPU time compared to the traditional discretization based on penta-diagonal and non-compact nona-diagonal stencils.
